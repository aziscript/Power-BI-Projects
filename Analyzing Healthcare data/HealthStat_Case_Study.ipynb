    "# Case Study: Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, you’ll explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a consulting company called **HealthStat**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll analyze attributes impacting the **patient length of stay (LOS)** and **cost**, and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. You’ll leverage your DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish off, you’ll bring it all together in a **sophisticated business dashboard** to communicate insights for the HealthStat team. This case study gives you a chance to practice a range of Power BI skills, working with real-world data.\n",
