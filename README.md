### 🚚 Supply Chain Analytics

- **Folder:** `Supply Chain Analytics/`
- **Notebook:** [`SupplyChain_Case_Study.ipynb`](Supply%20Chain%20Analytics/SupplyChain_Case_Study.ipynb)
- **Business Context:**  
  Tenate Industries frequently evaluates whether to **manufacture components internally** or **purchase them from suppliers**. This decision is influenced by:
  - Quoted supplier prices (Unit Cost + NRE)  
  - Internal manufacturing capabilities and capacity  
  - Capital investment requirements  
  - Volume-based cost changes  
  - Quality-related costs (based on yield rates)

  Traditional spreadsheets couldn’t efficiently handle this complexity. I was tasked with building a Power BI solution to enable dynamic scenario planning.
- **Skills:** DAX modeling, what-if analysis, cost modeling, decision support dashboard
